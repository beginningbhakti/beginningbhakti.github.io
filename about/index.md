# About Beginning Bhakti

Bhakti yoga is a beautiful though somewhat complex spiritual science. At the Bhaktivedanta Center/Bhakti House we noticed that new people enjoyed our systematic approach for presenting Bhakti Yoga. As others heard of our approach, we began getting requests to post our lectures so that as they learned or taught this science, they could refer to our syllabus and listen to the lectures for each topic presented each week at the Bhakti House. Thus, the idea for Beginning Bhakti was born. We humbly offer these lectures in the hope that they may help someone understand Bhakti yoga and begin its practice. The classes are given by practitioners of Bhakti, and most are young people. If you have questions from the classes, feel free to write to us at [bhakti@bhaktivedantacenter.com](mailto:bhakti@bhaktivedantacenter.com) for further explanation.

The Bhaktivedanta Center / Bhakti House (Charlottesville, Virginia) is an independent non-profit whose teachings are based on those of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, the greatest proponent of the Bhakti science, who tirelessly spread it to every continent before leaving this world in 1977. Our center is trying to faithfully teach this great spiritual science as he taught it to us, and thus enable a new generation to bring Bhakti Yoga into their lives in a loving and supportive environment.
