# About Beginning Bhakti

Bhakti yoga is a beautiful, holistic and intricate spiritual science. At the Bhaktivedanta Center, and Bhakti House, we try and present this ancient philosophy and practice in a way that is attractive and relevant to our community of students and professionals at the University of Virginia and neighboring areas. In doing so we noticed that newcomers to Bhakti enjoyed our systematic approach to presenting Bhakti Yoga. As others heard of our approach, we began getting requests to post our lectures online so that as they learned or taught this science, they could refer to our syllabus and listen to the lectures for each topic presented weekly at the Bhakti House. Thus, the idea for Beginning Bhakti was born. We humbly offer these lectures in the hope that they may help someone understand Bhakti yoga and begin applying it to their lives. The classes are given by practitioners of Bhakti, most of whom are young people who have been regulars at the Bhakti Yoga club of UVa for the past few years. If you have any questions, from the classes or otherwise, feel free to write to us at [bhakti@bhaktivedantacenter.com](mailto:bhakti@bhaktivedantacenter.com) for further explanation and more information.

The Bhaktivedanta Center (Charlottesville, Virginia) is an independent non-profit whose teachings are based on those of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, the pioneer of Bhakti Yoga in the western world. Our center is trying to faithfully teach this great spiritual science as taught by him, and thus enable a new generation to bring Bhakti Yoga into their lives in a loving and supportive environment of wisdom seekers.
