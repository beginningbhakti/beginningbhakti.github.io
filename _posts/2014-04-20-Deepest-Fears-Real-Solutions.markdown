Being alone is one of our greatest fears, in response to which, we have cocooned ourselves within a matrix of friends, family, and facebook. Society has constructed many levels of protection so that its people can be spared the dreaded depressions of a lonely mind. We have counselors, psychiatrists, support networks, academic advisors, career mentors, social networks, online dating, self-help books, and when all else fails, we have drugs, alcohol, and prostitution. The systems have been in place since time immemorial, yet who can say they have never been lonely, and never will be? But do we need to suffer? Is our suffering just something we must live with, or is it a prompting to make some changes? And what will soothe a fearful soul?

This week we will explore one of the deepest fears and yearnings of the heart, and offer positive remedies based on the science of Bhakti Yoga.
