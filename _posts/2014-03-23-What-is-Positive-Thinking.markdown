To buy gold yet not be cheated, one must know what gold is. Similarly, when we talk about positive thinking, we must know what is positive and what is negative! In this talk, we will discuss positive thinking in the light of the Bhagavad Gita. In doing so, we will see how Bhakti Yoga is transcendental to mundane labels like optimistic or pessimistic and yet is simultaneously uplifting, logical, realistic and supremely positive!
