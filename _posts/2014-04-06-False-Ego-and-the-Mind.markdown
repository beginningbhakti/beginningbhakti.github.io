We all thing of ourselves in a particular way. One may think of oneself as a "nice guy," "hard worker," "good student," or a "good friend." Or seen from a different angle, one may identify with one's country of birth, cultural upbringing, profession, family, etc. This is known as bodily identification, for it is always related to the body in a subtle or explicit way. The material mechanism responsible for this false idea of who we are is known as false egoÂ—literally, a "false sense of identity." So, why is this detrimental to our actual well-being? And what exactly is "true ego"? Join us this Sunday as we draw on some lessons from the cartoon Tom & Jerry to see how the false ego and the mind can be a destructive pair, but associating regularly with like-minded spiritual people is a tremendous force in overcoming them.
